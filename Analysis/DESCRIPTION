PDP_Working
Generate dependency plot for any model between any two features

PDP_MC
Generate dependency plot any model between any two features such that you are prediciting features that do not appear in the original dataset

XGB_tuning 
Works with 10% of the original dataset. 5 fold crossvalidation with that small set to determine ideal parameters. Retry with original parameters with full dataset, train on 40%, test on 60%, gives an ROC score of 96.5%, and a AUC of 94%. To get a 90% precision score, we have a recall of ~80% with a probability threshold of ~54%
